A frontend only Twitter clone to keep track of my #100DaysOfCode

Ironically, I was on this part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path when Elon Musk purchased Twitter, fired thousands of staff - including the entire accessibility team. Twitter was an amazing tool to keep track of daily coding in my first round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge. However, I couldn't ethically continue to use Twitter. So, here we are with my version of Twitter - Twimba. I've changed the Scrimba project colours to a dark theme that matches my Ginger Kiwi branding and am using css variables instead of hard coding the colours. I've also started to add both my #100DaysOfCode tweets to Day 060 and my records from Day 061 to today, Day 079 (November, 25, 2022).
